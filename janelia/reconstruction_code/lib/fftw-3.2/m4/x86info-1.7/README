x86info v1.7            http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/x86info
Dave Jones <davej@suse.de>

Somewhere in the mists of time, there was a program by Phil Karn (KA9Q)
called cpuid, which identified CPU. It didn't get updated very often,
and quickly got out of date. It also didn't do much more than just
simple decoding.

x86info was written to succeed Phils work. Initially, it borrowed some bits
from his code, but the last remnants are now long gone. Additional functionality
has been added, such as support for SMP, and building on non-Linux platforms.

For problems specific to the Cygwin/Win32 port, contact
Matthew Gregan <mgregan@jade.co.nz>.


Features:
 - SMP support.
 - Recognition of all Intel/AMD/IDT/Cyrix/VIA CPUs.
 - Parsing of model specific registers.
 - Approximation of current CPU MHz.


Caveats:
   For usage of the MSR / SMP functions, x86info needs the
   x86 cpuid driver provided with the Linux kernel 2.2.18 / 2.4.0,
   and the appropriate nodes in /dev

   To set up these devices, do the following..

	mkdir /dev/cpu
	for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
	do
		mkdir /dev/cpu/$i ; cd /dev/cpu/$i
		mknod cpuid c 203 $i
		mknod msr c 202 $i
	done

   To build under Win32/Cygwin, uncomment the second line
   in the Makefile, otherwise some files will fail to build.

   Usage under Win32 is somewhat limited at present:
	- no support for reading MSRs (anyone want to write a driver?)

   FreeBSD / OpenBSD / NetBSD also have the same limitations.

Info on the command line switches can be found in the man page.
