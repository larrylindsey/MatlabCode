- Identify Transmeta CPUs.

- Report the CPU packaging type on CPUs where info is available.

- --mtrr, --arr
  Dump MTRR/ARR registers.

- --apic
  Dump APIC registers

- Recognise CPUs with bugs, and print warnings
  if workarounds are not enabled. For example..
  "Stepping D0 Duron detected with Cache size bug.
   You should upgrade your kernel to work around this bug"

- --gcc option to output best optimisation parameters
  for that CPU.

- Some CPUs allow the name string to be changed.
  If this has happened we die horribly. We need to store the current
  name string, perform the cpuid reset sequence, and restore the
  name string on exit.
