                   libnpy

This is a small library for writing an array to a .npy file, so that it
can easily be loaded into a numpy application.  For a description of
the file format, do

>> from numpy.lib import format
>> help(format)

The od (octal dump) command provides a simple way to look at the contents
of a .npy file, and especially to check the metadata:

$ od -c file.npy


To build the libnpy and run a couple of simple test programs, go to
the src/ subdirectory and do

make
make check

The library provides the C functions

npy_save
npy_save_double
npy_save_float
npy_save_int
npy_save_float_complex
npy_save_double_complex

and a Fortran module fnpy containing the subroutines

save_single
save_double
save_integer
save_complex_single
save_complex_double

The function npy_save can write any type of array; the others are
convenience routines that call npy_save.

I have tested this code using gcc/gfortran 4.4.1 and numpy 1.3.0
on Fedora 11 (x86_64).

CHANGELOG

31/05/2009 Version 0.1

12/10/2009 Version 0.2: Change sizeof(...) to (int) sizeof(...) in
third argument of sprintf() to stop warnings from gcc-4.4.1.  Changed
int shape[ndims] to int* shape to work around a problem with nvcc,
the Nvidia cuda compiler (requested by Stéphane Gaudreault).

12/10/2009 Version 0.3: Modified include/npy.h to add extern "C" when
compiled with C++ (suggested by Stéphane Gaudreault).
