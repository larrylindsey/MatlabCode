/* A Paint_Brush specifies how to modify each pixel while performing any of the draw operations
   below.  Its consists of [0,1] values for each primary color and a specification of how to
   use these values coded in "op".  For non-COLOR images, the red value is taken as the one to
   draw with.  For COLOR images, a negative color value signals that that channel should not be
   painted.  The "op" directive controls painting as follows:

   SET: each pixel value is set to the draw value.
   ADD: each pixel value has the draw value added to it,
           and the pixel is clipped if it over-flows.
   SUB: each pixel value has the draw value subtracted from it,
           and the pixel is clipped if it under-flows.
   MUL: each pixel is multiplied by the draw value.
   MAX: each pixel is set to the maximum of its current value and the draw value.
   MIN: each pixel is set to the minimum of its current value and the draw value.

   In the case of GREY and GREY16 images the draw value is scaled to the range of the image, i.e.
   [0,255] and [0,65535], save for the MUL directive where it remains a real value between 0 and 1
