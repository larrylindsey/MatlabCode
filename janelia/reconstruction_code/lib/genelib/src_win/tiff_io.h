*    This program reads and writes .tif files without really understanding anything more  *
*    than that it is a header that has a linked lists of image file descriptors (ifd's)   *
*    that contain a collection of tags, one of which is an array pointing to blocks of    *
*    image data (TIFF_TILE_OFFSETS or TIFF_STRIP_OFFSETS) and another of which is an      *
*    array of byte counts for each block (TIFF_TILE_BYTE_COUNTS or TIFF_STRIP_BYTE_COUNTS, *
*    respectively).                                                                       *

*    You can add, delete, and modify tags from each image as you wish.                    *

*    In addition, we have "Tiff_Annotator" routines that allow one to efficiently         *
*      write a TIFF_JF_TAGGER tag that points at a string buffer that is always           *
*      guaranteed to be at the end of the file so that changing it just is a matter of    *
*      rewriting the last bit of the file.                                                *

*    The routines can also read and write .lsm files, consolidating them as proper tifs   *
*      once read and minimally reintroducing the essential "quirks" that an .lsm reader   *
*      would expect when writing back out (as a .lsm)                                     *

/* A tiff file consists of a header that "points" to a linked list of image file descriptors
   (IFD's).  While it is not required, each IFD typically encodes an image, a Tiff file with
   more than one IFD typically encodes a stack of images.  Each IFD consists of a variable #
   of tags that have a label, type, count, and value.  The standard tag labels and their codes
   are given above, as are the possible range of types.  Each tag encodes an array of count
   values of the given type.  The standard describes how these are encoded in a file, but a
   user of this library is shielded from these details.

   Native_endian returns a non-zero value if and only if the native machine order is big-endian.
   Tiff_Is_LSM when called with a Tiff_Reader or Tiff_Writer returns a non-zero value only if the
   file was opened as a Zeiss lsm file.  For those routines that have error exits, you can get
   a text string describing the particular error that occured by calling Tiff_Error_String.  The
   string is managed by the package and should not be freed by the user.
*/

int   Native_Endian();
int   Tiff_Is_LSM(void *tif);
char *Tiff_Error_String();

/* One can open a tif file with Open_Tiff_Reader creating a Tiff_Reader object that can be used
   to access the file's IFD's sequentially with Read_Tiff_IFD.  The routine returns NULL if
   the file cannot be read or the contents of the file are not that of a Tiff file.  One can skip
   over the next IFD with Advance_Tiff_Reader, start accessing IFD's from the beginning again with
   Rewind_Tiff_Reader, and can test if any IFD's remain with End_Of_Tiff.  Advance_Tiff_Reader
   returns a non-zero value if the Tiff is not properly encoded or is at the last IFD, and
   End_OF_Tiff returns a non-zero value if the last IFD has been read.

   Data blocks can be compressed shorts or ints in an endian order dependent on the producing
   machine.  Presumably the endian indicator of the TIFF file is correct for that data (either
   that or *somebody elses* reader/writer has already blown it :-))   Therefore, Open_Tiff_Reader
   returns the endian indicator "big_endian" for the image data.  All IFD's read from this file
   will assume that this is the endian order of the image data and a Tiff_Writer will write
   all the data out in this endian in order to guarantee the correct downstream interpreation
   of the data.  Note carefully, that all tags in an IFD are in native endian order while in
   memory (they are flipped on read and/or write as necessary).  If you create a tif by creating
   and writing a series of IFD's, then the tiff endian will be that which is native to the
   producing machine (Native_Endian returns 0 iff native order is little-endian).

   LSM FILES:

   If the Tiff_Reader is opened for an LSM file, by passing a non-zero value for the parameter
   lsm to Open_Tiff_Reader, then it assumes it is reading an lsm file as encoded by the Zeiss
   spec if ROWS_PER_STRIP is not defined.  In this case it restores the encoding to that of a
   true tiff by removing the following "warts":
     (a) the BITS_PER_PIXEL vector is placed in the value field of the tag if it fits
     (b) the color map is shifted to use the high-order bytes if the low-order bytes were used,
     (c) a tag for ROWS_PER_STRIP is added, 
     (d) the CZ_LSM_INFO tag is a block that points at other blocks that are not necessarily
            contiguous.  These are consolidated into a single block, the count-field of *the*
            tag is set to the size of this block and all sub-block offsets become relative to
            this super-block (as opposed to the start of the file), and
     (e) STRIP_BYTE_COUNTs are accurately computed by lzw decoding each strip if
            the lsm is compressed.
   Fix (e) takes a bit of extra time but is necessary if one is to strictly adhere to the standard.
   If the Tiff_Reader is for an lsm but ROWS_PER_STRIP is defined, then the package assumes
   it is reading an LSM file that it wrote (see below) in which case only wart (a) remains and
   needs to be handled.

   While the tags may not be in ascending order of labels internaly, Write_Tiff_IFD, sorts them
   before writing so that a standard tiff results from a write.  However, if the Tiff_Writer is
   asked to write a .lsm file, then Write_Tiff_IFD reintroduces wart (a) as it writes out the file,
   so that other ".lsm" readers (such as Image J or Zeiss's software) can open it.  The fixing of
   the other warts should not affect ".lsm" readers (confirmed for Image J).

/* While this reader/writer can read and write LSM's this was done primarily so that we could
   continue to use ImageJ.  But ImageJ has also been fixed, at our request (version 1.39q),
   so that it can read compressed RGB tiffs.  So to get completely away from .lsm, one can
   convert an encoding of a <= 3-channel lsm to either a grey-scale tiff if there is 1 channel,
   and an RGB tiff if there are 2 or 3 channels.  The routine returns NULL if the current IFD
   is for a thumb-nail, otherwise it returns the IFD save that in the case it is for a 2-channel
   .lsm, it addes a third channel to make it an RGB image.  In this case, channel source
   (= 0 or 1) is mapped to channel target (= 0(R) 1(G) or 2(B)) and the other two RGB channels
   assume the values of channel 1-source.

   To help one decide how to map channels in the 2-channel case, Get_LSM_Colors returns the
   number of channels in the integer pointed at by nchannels, and an array to the rgb colors
   as its result.  The array is static to Get_LSM_Colors and reset on each call.

/* In order to facilitate annotating a file this library supports a special tag, TIFF_JF_TAGGER,
   that holds an ASCII array of arbitrary length that presumably contains an encoding a some
   annotation of the image.  In order to facilitate rapid reading and writing of this tag
   independent of the total file size, the tag must be in the first IFD and its value must
   constitute a suffix of the file (i.e. be located at the end of the file).  To this end
   the Tiff_Writer routines are guaranteed to place the value of a TIFF_JF_TAGGER tag in the
   *first* IFD at the end of the file.

   One can open a tiff for the purposes of getting or setting its annotation by creating a
   Tiff_Annotator object with Open_Tiff_Annotator.  NULL is returned if either the file is
   not read/write permitted, the format is not recognizable, or *** there is no annotation tag
   in the first IFD or its value is not a suffix of the file ***.  In such an event, you can
   request that the file be "formatted for annotation" by calling Format_Tiff_For_Annotation.
   This is an expensive operation requiring time proportional to the length of the file.  It
   returns a non-zero value if there is an error (file not read/write permitted or format not
   recognizable).  Generally you want to know why a file can't be opened for annotation and
   Tiff_Annotation_Status returns that a file is not r+ openable, is not a tiff (as far as it
   can tell), is a tiff but not formated, or is good to go.

   Given that Open_Tiff_Annotator succeeded, you can get the annotation with Get_Tiff_Annotation
   and set it with Set_Tiff_Annotation.  Note carefully that the annotation is not a C string
   but simply an array of chars of some length, so that you can concatenate as many C-strings into
   the value of an annotation as you wish.

   The Tiff_Annotator must be closed with Close_Tiff_Annotator if you want any changes to the
   annotation to be saved.
