function imageDistortionMap(tr, n, lim, f, varargin)
%  imageDistortionMap(tr, n, lim, f, ...)
% Creates a visual representation of the distortion map of a transform
% Two subplots are created, one to display the pixel-magnitude of the
% distortion map, and another to display the orientation.
%  
% tr [struct] - the transform struct
% n [1] or [2] - n(1) is the number of sample points, in each dimension. 
%       IE, an n-by-n distortion image will be created.
%       n(2) is the number of sample points to use for the vector map, in
%       other words n(2) * n(2) arrows will be plotted over the
%       color-vector-field. When n is a singleton, the value in n(1) is
%       used instead.
% lim [2] - The boundaries of the domain. For instance, the transform is
%       usually calculated over an image that has been geometrically
%       normalized, so that its pixels are located between -1 and 1, in
%       both x- and y-directions. In this case, lim = [-1 1].
% f [1] - the size factor. In the example above, if the original image was
%       a 16384-by-16384 image, then f = 16384 / (1 - (-1)) = 16384 / 2 =
%       8192.
% ... - any additional arguments are passed directly into the quiver
%       command, used to draw the arrows on the plot
